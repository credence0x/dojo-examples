## In-Game Item Claiming with NFT Minting
This example illustrates an in-game scenario where players can claim various virtual items, which have specific experience point (XP) requirements. Upon successfully claiming an item, an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) representing the item is minted to the player's blockchain address, thereby giving the player ownership of a unique digital asset.

### Models and Workflow
The system is built around two main models:

1. **Player Model**: Represents an individual player, holding essential information such as the player's blockchain address and the total experience points they have accumulated throughout their gameplay. 

2. **Item Model**: Contains details pertinent to specific in-game items, such as:
   - The address of the associated NFT contract
   - The required experience points needed to claim the item
   - The total number of times the item has been minted so far (i.e., how many players have claimed it)

### Claiming Process
The process to claim an item and mint the corresponding NFT token involves the following steps:

1. **Invoking the Claim**: The `claim_item` system is called with two arguments: the nft address and the item id.

2. **Experience Points Check**: The system first verifies whether the claimant's accumulated experience points meet or exceed the required amount for the selected item. If not, the claim is rejected.

3. **Token Transfer**: If the claimant's experience points are sufficient, the `transfer_from` method of the `ERC721` contract( as defined in the dojo_erc crate ) is invoked to transfer the NFT from the the world address to the claimant's address.

This example showcases how traditional game mechanics (like experience points) can be integrated with blockchain technology to create a dynamic and engaging player experience, while also providing an innovative way to represent in-game ownership via NFTs.
